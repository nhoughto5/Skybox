Toughts on improvements:

1.) End array could be an array of pointers. Randomize which Card memory addresses they point to.
2.) Use a c++ style array (std::array, std::vector)

LookUps:
1.) Originally was going to use #define for the constant but had a hunch it was not best practice. Looked it up.
2.) Visual studio gave me compile errors for _TCHAR and strlen. Had to look up what headers they are in.
